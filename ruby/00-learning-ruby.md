# So you want to learn Ruby?

For learning the fundamentals of Ruby I recommend [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/).  It focuses on helping you internalize the fundamentals rather than skipping to advanced concepts.  This will be more useful to you in working around programmers than it will be to try and skip to the end.  Enjoy!
